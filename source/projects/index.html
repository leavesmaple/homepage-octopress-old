<h2>EditorConfig</h2>

<section>
<p>
<a href=http://editorconfig.org>EditorConfig</a> helps developers define and
maintain consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs. The
EditorConfig project consists of <strong>a file format</strong> for defining
coding styles and a collection of <strong>text editor plugins</strong> that
enable editors to read the file format and adhere to defined styles.
EditorConfig files are easily readibly and they work nicely with version
control systems.

Visit <a href=http://editorconfig.org>EditorConfig project page</a> to know
more about it.

<h3><a href="http://cmdlauncher.nongnu.org">CmdLauncher</a></h3>

<p>
Help people use command line tools in a graphical environment.<br>
<br>
This project is aimed at helping people launch a command in a graphical way.
Command line tools are powerful, but some people, especially those who are not
computer experts, are unwilling to use command line tools because they need to
memorize many things to type a command. But CmdLauncher provide a simple way
for developers to make their console programs launch by selecting one from the
list, or choosing a file, or something else which could be done easily by
people who are not experts. What the command line program developers need to do
is to write a simple ini format file containing information of their command
line programs, which will be read by CmdLauncher.
